    "\n",
    "1. `def reduce_mem_usage(df, verbose=0):`\n",
    "   - This line defines a function called `reduce_mem_usage` that takes two parameters: `df`, which is the input Pandas DataFrame that needs memory optimization, and `verbose` (defaulting to 0), which is a flag to control whether or not to provide memory optimization information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `start_mem = df.memory_usage().sum() / 1024**2`\n",
    "   - This line calculates the initial memory usage of the input DataFrame `df` and stores it in the `start_mem` variable. It does this by using the `memory_usage()` method, which returns the memory usage of each column, and then sums these values. The result is divided by 1024^2 to convert it to megabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The code then enters a loop that iterates through each column of the DataFrame using the `for col in df.columns:` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside the loop, it checks the data type of the column using `col_type = df[col].dtype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If the column's data type is not 'object' (i.e., it's numeric), it proceeds with the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For integer columns:\n",
    "   - It checks the minimum and maximum values in the column (c_min and c_max).\n",
    "   - Depending on the range of values, it converts the column to the smallest integer data type that can accommodate the data while reducing memory usage. It checks for `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, and `int64` data types based on the data range.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. For float columns:\n",
    "   - Similar to integer columns, it checks the minimum and maximum values.\n",
    "   - It converts the column to a `float32` data type if the range is within the limits of `np.finfo(np.float32)`. The `np.finfo()` function is used to get the floating-point type's limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If the column's data type is neither integer nor float and falls outside the specified ranges, it defaults to `float32`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. If `verbose` is set to a truthy value (e.g., 1), it provides information about memory optimization, including the initial and final memory usage, and the percentage reduction in memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Finally, the function returns the DataFrame with optimized memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is useful for reducing the memory footprint of a DataFrame, especially when working with large datasets, by converting columns to the most memory-efficient data types based on the data they contain. It can help improve performance and reduce memory-related issues."

    "This code includes functions for calculating triplet imbalance in a parallel and optimized manner using the Numba library. Let's break down each part of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `from numba import njit, prange`\n",
    "   - This line imports two important features from the Numba library: `njit` for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and `prange` for parallel processing. JIT compilation can significantly speed up the execution of code, and parallel processing allows for concurrent execution of code in a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `@njit(parallel=True)`\n",
    "   - This is a decorator applied to the `compute_triplet_imbalance` function, indicating that Numba should compile this function for speed optimization and parallel execution. This decorator makes use of Numba's features to enhance the performance of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `def compute_triplet_imbalance(df_values, comb_indices):`\n",
    "   - This function is designed to calculate triplet imbalance in a parallelized manner using Numba. It takes two parameters:\n",
    "     - `df_values`: A NumPy array containing the values of the DataFrame. It represents the price data.\n",
    "     - `comb_indices`: A list of combinations of three price indices (a, b, c) for which triplet imbalance needs to be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `num_rows = df_values.shape[0]`\n",
    "   - This line calculates the number of rows in the `df_values` array, which represents the number of rows in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `imbalance_features = np.empty((num_rows, num_combinations))`\n",
    "   - This line initializes an empty NumPy array `imbalance_features` with dimensions (number of rows, number of combinations). This array will store the computed triplet imbalance values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The code then enters a loop that iterates through all combinations of triplets specified by `comb_indices`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `for i in prange(num_combinations):`\n",
    "   - This loop is parallelized using `prange`, which allows for multiple combinations to be processed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Inside the loop, it extracts the indices (a, b, c) for the current combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Another loop iterates through the rows of the DataFrame (`for j in range(num_rows)`) and calculates the triplet imbalance for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `max_val`, `min_val`, and `mid_val` are computed for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `if mid_val == min_val:` checks if division by zero would occur and sets the corresponding entry in `imbalance_features` to `np.nan` to prevent errors in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. The final imbalance value is calculated using the formula `(max_val - mid_val) / (mid_val - min_val)` and stored in the `imbalance_features` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. The function returns the `imbalance_features` array, which contains the computed triplet imbalance values for all combinations and rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. `calculate_triplet_imbalance_numba` is another function that takes a price column name and a DataFrame as input. It prepares the data and calculates triplet imbalance using the `compute_triplet_imbalance` function. It returns the result as a DataFrame with appropriately labeled columns.\n"

    "**Explaination**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code block is responsible for making predictions in inference mode and submitting them to the Optiver 2023 competition environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `def zero_sum(prices, volumes):`\n",
    "   - This function takes two NumPy arrays, `prices` and `volumes`, as input.\n",
    "   - It calculates the standard error as the square root of the `volumes`.\n",
    "   - It calculates a variable `step` by dividing the sum of `prices` by the sum of the standard errors (`std_error`).\n",
    "   - It calculates the `out` variable as the difference between the `prices` and the product of the `std_error` and the `step`.\n",
    "   - The function returns the `out` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `if is_infer:`\n",
    "   - This condition checks if the variable `is_infer` is `True`. If it is `True`, it means that the code is being executed in inference mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside the `if is_infer:` block:\n",
    "   - The code imports the `optiver2023` module and creates an environment (`env`) for the Optiver 2023 competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It initializes variables, including an iterator (`iter_test`), a counter (`counter`), and variables for specifying the lower and upper limits of predictions (`y_min` and `y_max`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It also initializes lists for recording queries per second (`qps`) and a DataFrame (`cache`) to store test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The code enters a loop that iterates through the test data provided by the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Inside the loop:\n",
    "   - It records the current time (`now_time`) using the `time.time()` function.\n",
    "   - It concatenates the current test data with the existing cache of data.\n",
    "   - It keeps only the most recent 21 rows for each stock and sorts them.\n",
    "   - It generates features for the current test data using the `generate_all_features` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. It makes predictions using the previously trained inference LightGBM model (`infer_lgb_model`).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. It applies the `zero_sum` function to transform the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. It clips the transformed predictions to ensure they fall within the specified range defined by `y_min` and `y_max`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. It updates the sample prediction with the clipped values.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. It submits the predictions to the environment using the `env.predict()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. It updates the counter and records the time spent on each iteration in the `qps` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. It prints the current iteration number and the average queries per second (qps) if the counter is a multiple of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. After processing all test data, it calculates the estimated time cost based on the average qps and prints the estimated time to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is designed for making predictions in an Optiver trading competition environment and uses a trained LightGBM model for inference. It also includes a transformation step (`zero_sum`) and clipping of predictions to ensure they are within a specified range before submitting them to the competition environment."
