    "   - This line defines a function called `reduce_mem_usage` that takes two parameters: `df`, which is the input Pandas DataFrame that needs memory optimization, and `verbose` (defaulting to 0), which is a flag to control whether or not to provide memory optimization information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `start_mem = df.memory_usage().sum() / 1024**2`\n",
    "   - This line calculates the initial memory usage of the input DataFrame `df` and stores it in the `start_mem` variable. It does this by using the `memory_usage()` method, which returns the memory usage of each column, and then sums these values. The result is divided by 1024^2 to convert it to megabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The code then enters a loop that iterates through each column of the DataFrame using the `for col in df.columns:` loop.\n",

    "   - It checks the minimum and maximum values in the column (c_min and c_max).\n",
    "   - Depending on the range of values, it converts the column to the smallest integer data type that can accommodate the data while reducing memory usage. It checks for `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, and `int64` data types based on the data range.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. For float columns:\n",
    "   - Similar to integer columns, it checks the minimum and maximum values.\n",
    "   - It converts the column to a `float32` data type if the range is within the limits of `np.finfo(np.float32)`. The `np.finfo()` function is used to get the floating-point type's limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If the column's data type is neither integer nor float and falls outside the specified ranges, it defaults to `float32`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. If `verbose` is set to a truthy value (e.g., 1), it provides information about memory optimization, including the initial and final memory usage, and the percentage reduction in memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Finally, the function returns the DataFrame with optimized memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is useful for reducing the memory footprint of a DataFrame, especially when working with large datasets, by converting columns to the most memory-efficient data types based on the data they contain. It can help improve performance and reduce memory-related issues."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This code includes functions for calculating triplet imbalance in a parallel and optimized manner using the Numba library. Let's break down each part of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `from numba import njit, prange`\n",
    "   - This line imports two important features from the Numba library: `njit` for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and `prange` for parallel processing. JIT compilation can significantly speed up the execution of code, and parallel processing allows for concurrent execution of code in a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `@njit(parallel=True)`\n",
    "   - This is a decorator applied to the `compute_triplet_imbalance` function, indicating that Numba should compile this function for speed optimization and parallel execution. This decorator makes use of Numba's features to enhance the performance of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `def compute_triplet_imbalance(df_values, comb_indices):`\n",
    "   - This function is designed to calculate triplet imbalance in a parallelized manner using Numba. It takes two parameters:\n",
    "     - `df_values`: A NumPy array containing the values of the DataFrame. It represents the price data.\n",
    "     - `comb_indices`: A list of combinations of three price indices (a, b, c) for which triplet imbalance needs to be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `num_rows = df_values.shape[0]`\n",
    "   - This line calculates the number of rows in the `df_values` array, which represents the number of rows in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `imbalance_features = np.empty((num_rows, num_combinations))`\n",

    "   - Finally, it calculates additional features, including momentum, spread, intensity, pressure, market urgency, and depth pressure.\n",
    "   - It also calculates statistical aggregation features (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) for both price and size columns.\n",
    "   - Shifted, return, and diff features are generated for specific columns.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. `generate_all_features(df)`:\n",
    "   - This function combines the features generated by the `imbalance_features` and `other_features` functions.\n",
    "   - It selects the relevant columns for feature generation, applies the `imbalance_features` function, adds time and stock-related features using the `other_features` function, and then performs garbage collection to free up memory.\n",
    "   - The function returns a DataFrame containing the generated features, excluding certain columns like \"row_id,\" \"target,\" \"time_id,\" and \"date_id.\"\n"

    "1. `if is_offline:`:\n",
    "   - This condition checks if the variable `is_offline` is `True`. If it is `True`, it means the code is running in offline mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the offline mode block:\n",
    "   - The code splits the dataset into two parts: `df_train` and `df_valid` based on the value of the `split_day`. Data with \"date_id\" less than or equal to the `split_day` is assigned to `df_train`, while data with \"date_id\" greater than the `split_day` is assigned to `df_valid`.\n",
    "   - It then displays a message indicating that the code is running in offline mode and provides the shapes (number of rows and columns) of the training and validation sets using the `print` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the online mode block:\n",
    "   - If the code is not running in offline mode (i.e., `is_offline` is `False`), it means it's running in online mode.\n",
    "   - In online mode, the entire dataset is used for training, and the entire dataset is assigned to `df_train`.\n",
    "   - It displays a message indicating that the code is running in online mode using the `print` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of distinguishing between offline and online modes is often related to the context in which the code is used. In offline mode, you typically have historical data and can perform tasks like data splitting for training and validation, while in online mode, you might be working with real-time data and use the entire dataset for training. The choice of mode can impact the preprocessing and analysis steps that follow in the code."

    "This code block is responsible for making predictions in inference mode and submitting them to the Optiver 2023 competition environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code seems to be part of a larger program related to financial trading or simulation. Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function `zero_sum`**\n",
    "   - **Parameters:** `prices` (array of prices), `volumes` (array of volumes)\n",
    "   - **Functionality:** Calculates the standard error based on volumes, then computes a step size based on prices and the standard error. Finally, it adjusts prices by subtracting the standardized step size.\n",
    "   - **Returns:** Adjusted prices array (`out`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inference Environment Check**\n",
    "   - **Condition:** `is_infer` (assumed to be a boolean variable)\n",
    "   - **Functionality:** If in inference mode, import the `optiver2023` module and set up the environment. It also initializes some variables like `iter_test`, `counter`, `y_min`, `y_max`, `qps`, `predictions`, and `cache`.\n",
    "   - **Model Weights:** Initializes weights for each fold model as a list of equal weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iteration through Test Scenarios**\n",
    "   - **Loop:** Iterates through each test scenario provided by `iter_test`.\n",
    "   - **Cache Update:** Appends the test data to the cache and, if not the first iteration, limits the cache to the last 21 rows for each stock.\n",
    "   - **Feature Generation:** Generates features based on the updated cache.\n",
    "   - **Model Prediction:** Generates predictions for each model and calculates the weighted average of the predictions.\n",
    "   - **Adjusting Predictions:** Uses the `zero_sum` function to adjust predictions based on bid and ask sizes. The adjusted predictions are then clipped to be within a specified range (`y_min` to `y_max`).\n",
    "   - **Submission:** Updates the target in the sample prediction and submits the prediction to the environment.\n",
    "   - **Performance Monitoring:** Tracks the time taken for each iteration (`qps`), and prints the average queries per second every 10 iterations.\n",
    "   - **Time Estimation:** Estimates the total time the code will take to complete all iterations.\n"
